# ORFS v1.2 Feature Documentation

**Version:** 1.2  
**Last Updated:** 2025-03-28

## Introduction

ORFS v1.2 builds upon the marketing and narrative capabilities introduced in v1.1 with several powerful enhancements:

1. **Multiple Upgrade Options** - Support for multiple premium modifications per dish
2. **Limited-Time Offer (LTO) Details** - Structured time-bound offer data
3. **Customer Feedback Summary** - Highlight customer favorites and review sentiment
4. **Enhanced LLM Integration** - Improved prompt guidance for auto-generating engaging marketing content

This document details these new features and provides implementation examples.

## Multiple Upgrade Options

In v1.1, each dish could have at most one upgrade option. ORFS v1.2 transforms `upgrade_options` from a single object to an array, allowing restaurants to offer multiple premium modifications per dish. This enables more diverse upselling opportunities.

### Protobuf Definition

```protobuf
// Dish message excerpt
message Dish {
  // Fields from v1.1...
  
  // Upgrade options for this dish - now an array in v1.2
  repeated UpgradeOption upgrade_options = 27;
  
  // Other fields...
}
```

### JSON Example

```json
"upgrade_options": [
  {
    "new_name": "Truffle Marinara Pizza",
    "new_price": 2700,
    "marketing_copy": "Experience the luxurious twist with black truffle oil and aged Parmigiano—an upgrade that celebrates local flavor with a touch of indulgence."
  },
  {
    "new_name": "Vegan Marinara Pizza",
    "new_price": 2400,
    "marketing_copy": "Our plant-based version replaces traditional cheese with our house-made cashew ricotta, delivering all the flavor with none of the dairy."
  }
]
```

## Limited-Time Offer (LTO) Details

ORFS v1.2 introduces a dedicated structure for limited-time offers at the dish level. This allows restaurants to define time-bound promotions with explicit start and end times, plus marketing copy.

### Protobuf Definition

```protobuf
// LTO details message
message LtoDetails {
  // Start timestamp (POSIX epoch seconds)
  uint64 start_time = 1;
  
  // End timestamp (POSIX epoch seconds)
  uint64 end_time = 2;
  
  // Marketing copy for the limited-time offer
  string marketing_copy = 3;
}

// Dish message excerpt
message Dish {
  // Other fields...
  
  // Limited Time Offer details
  LtoDetails lto_details = 30;
  
  // Other fields...
}
```

### JSON Example

```json
"lto_details": {
  "start_time": 1700200000,
  "end_time": 1700203600,
  "marketing_copy": "Limited Time: Try our exclusive Truffle Marinara this week only! Made with rare black truffles from our partner farm."
}
```

## Customer Feedback Summary

ORFS v1.2 introduces a new `customer_feedback_summary` field to capture aggregate customer sentiment or highlight customer favorites.

### Protobuf Definition

```protobuf
// Dish message excerpt
message Dish {
  // Other fields...
  
  // Summary of customer feedback or customer favorite status
  string customer_feedback_summary = 31;
  
  // Other fields...
}
```

### JSON Example

```json
"customer_feedback_summary": "92% positive reviews – consistently mentioned as the most authentic Neapolitan-style pizza in Sonoma!"
```

## Enhanced LLM Integration

While v1.1 introduced basic LLM guidance fields, v1.2 enhances these capabilities with more structured prompt templates that better support auto-generation of marketing content.

### Best Practices for LLM Integration

When utilizing ORFS data with Large Language Models, consider these practices:

1. **Use Dish-Level Context**: Include `chef_story`, `ingredient_story`, and `seasonal_story` in prompts for richer, more authentic content.

2. **Incorporate Key Message Points**: Always reference the `key_message_points` array to maintain consistent messaging.

3. **Adapt Marketing by Channel**: The `suggested_prompt_template` field now supports channel-specific variations using the format: `{social_media|menu|website}`.

4. **Leverage Customer Sentiment**: The new `customer_feedback_summary` field can be incorporated into LLM prompts to highlight popular dishes.

### Example Prompt Template

```
Create a {social_media|menu|website} description for our {dish.name}, highlighting the {ingredient_story} and {chef_story}. 
Include details about our {supplier_location.compact} sourcing and {sustainability_impact}.
Mention that it's {customer_feedback_summary}.

If applicable, highlight our current limited offer: {lto_details.marketing_copy}
```

## Validation Requirements

ORFS v1.2 maintains strict validation rules for all new fields:

1. For `upgrade_options`:
   - Each option must include `new_name`, `new_price`, and `marketing_copy`
   - The `new_price` must be a positive number

2. For `lto_details`:
   - `start_time` and `end_time` must be valid timestamps
   - `end_time` must be greater than `start_time`
   - `marketing_copy` must be a non-empty string with reasonable length

3. For `customer_feedback_summary`:
   - Must be a string with minimum length requirements

The ORFS validator tool has been updated to validate these fields according to the specification.

## Backward Compatibility

All new v1.2 fields are optional, ensuring full backward compatibility with v1.0 and v1.1 implementations. If you're upgrading from a previous version, no changes to existing fields are required.
