ORFS is an open, real-time protocol for restaurants to broadcast detailed information about their menus, dishes, tables, and ingredients. ORFS uses Protocol Buffers for efficient real-time feeds and JSON for static data interchange. Version 1.2 enhances the specification with multiple upgrade options, limited-time offers, customer feedback summaries, and improved LLM integration to generate more compelling content.

## Overview

This repository contains:
- **Protobuf Definitions:** Found in `proto/orfs.proto`
- **JSON Schemas:** In the `best-practices/` folder, providing full validation for Restaurant, Menu, Dish, Table, Ingredient, Bundle, and marketing extension types.
- **Examples:** Example static feed and real-time feed files in `examples/`, including v1.2 examples demonstrating the latest features.

## Quick Start

1. **Generating Code from Protobuf:**

   ```bash
   # For example, to generate Python classes:
   protoc --python_out=. proto/orfs.proto
   ```

2. **Validating a JSON Feed:**

   Use the provided Python validator:

   ```bash
   python tools/validator.py examples/static_feed.json best-practices/restaurant.schema.json
   ```

3. **Running the Sample Consumer:**

   This sample consumer reads a real-time feed (protobuf or JSON) and prints updates.

   ```bash
   python tools/sample_consumer.py examples/realtime_feed.json
   ```
